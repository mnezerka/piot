# PIOT

PIOT is open source and patent-free IoT cloud platform. The name PIOT is a
shortcut which stands for Pavoucek Internet Of Things, where Pavoucek (Spider)
is name of the company that has strong interest in driving this project.

The main motivation for starting this project was a need for platform that
supports our (business) use cases:

- Selling things as a service to customers (represented as organizations)
- Provide nice UIs and possibility to call APIs without affecting other
  organizations (multitenancy)
- Management of IOT devices, users and organizations
- Possibility to connect cheap and simple sensors with limited capabilities
  (e.g. low memory), assembled and deployed by us
- Receive data from sensors communicating in proprietary protocols (e.g. HTTP
  packets of minimal size)
- Easy integration of 3rd party applications (e.g. NodeRed)
- Openness to world of IOT devices that are already on the market
- Integration with Prometheus and Grafana as this is one of the main
  use cases sold to customers
- Persistency of selected IOT data to provide information from history
