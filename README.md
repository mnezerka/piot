- Possibility to connect cheap and simple sensors with limited capabilities
  (e.g. low memory), assembled and deployed by us
- Receive data from sensors ommunicating via various protocols (e.g. HTTP
  packets with minimal footprint)
- Easy integration of 3rd party applications (e.g. NodeRed)
- Openness to world of IOT devices that are already on the market
- Integration with Prometheus and Grafana as this is our main use
  case for our customers.
- Persistency of specific IOT data to be able to look back into
